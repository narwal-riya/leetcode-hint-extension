# leetcode-hint-extension
A simple Chrome extension I built to make problem-solving on LeetCode smoother.  
Instead of searching for hints all over the internet, this extension provides **quick, problem-specific hints** directly inside the LeetCode page so that you try thinking and solving on your own.  

## Features
- ðŸ’¡ General hints for any problem  
- ðŸ“Œ Topic-specific hints (Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Binary Tree, Graphs, etc.)  
- âš¡ Fast & lightweight â€“ no external APIs  
- ðŸŽ¯ Encourages you to think and solve instead of just copying solutions  

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP.  
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.  
3. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right).  
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder.  
5. Open a LeetCode problem and click on the ðŸ’¡ button for hints!
